# TaskFlow Pro - Task Completion Persistence Fix

## Issue Identified

The light green background for completed tasks was not persisting properly in some cases due to:
1. CSS specificity issues that could override the completed task styling
2. Potential state update conflicts in the optimistic UI update logic

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced CSS Specificity
```css
.task.completed {
  background: rgba(0, 201, 167, 0.15) !important; /* Light green background */
  border-left: 5px solid var(--success) !important;
}
```
Added `!important` flags to both background and border properties to ensure they take precedence over any conflicting styles.

### 2. Improved State Update Logic
Changed from:
```javascript
setTasks(tasks.map(task => 
  task.id === taskId ? { ...task, is_completed: !currentStatus } : task
))
```

To:
```javascript
setTasks(prevTasks => 
  prevTasks.map(task => 
    task.id === taskId ? { ...task, is_completed: newStatus } : task
  )
)
```

This ensures we're always working with the latest state, preventing potential race conditions.

## Technical Details

### CSS Changes
- Added `!important` to both background and border-left properties in `.task.completed`
- Maintained all existing styling while ensuring proper override capability

### JavaScript Improvements
- Used functional state updates to ensure consistency
- Pre-calculated the new status to avoid multiple negations
- Maintained all existing error handling and user feedback mechanisms

## Testing Verification

1. Click "Mark Complete" on any task:
   - Task immediately gets light green background
   - Background persists without requiring page refresh
   - Button text changes to "Mark Incomplete"

2. Click "Mark Incomplete" on a completed task:
   - Light green background is removed
   - Button text changes back to "Mark Complete"

3. Refresh page:
   - Task states are preserved from server data
   - Completed tasks maintain light green background
   - Incomplete tasks maintain default styling

## Expected Behavior

The light green background will now persist on completed tasks until "Mark Incomplete" is clicked, with the following guarantees:
- Immediate visual feedback on user action
- Persistence across component re-renders
- Consistency with server state
- Proper cleanup when task is marked incomplete

These changes ensure a reliable and consistent user experience for task completion status visualization.
